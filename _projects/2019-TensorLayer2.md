TensorLayer is a novel TensorFlow-based deep learning and reinforcement learning library designed for researchers and engineers. It provides a large collection of customizable neural layers / functions that are key to build real-world AI applications. TensorLayer is awarded the 2017 Best Open Source Software by the ACM Multimedia Society.

The community of TensorLayer is currently working on a major update of TensorLayer from 1.x to 2.0 following the release of [TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha](https://medium.com/tensorflow/test-drive-tensorflow-2-0-alpha-b6dd1e522b01).

Recent updates of TensorLayer2 is available:
* [TensorLayer2 Repo](https://github.com/zsdonghao/tensorlayer2/tree/tl2-layer)
* [TensorLayer2 Progress](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer/issues/900)
 
We plan to provide
* APIs with nearly zero-cost and moderate abstraction for flexibility.
* Simplified APIs to support both graph and eager execution.
* A complete working flow from data processing to model deployment.
* Tutorial and examples friendly to beginners and experts.
