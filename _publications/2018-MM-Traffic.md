## Abstract
With the ever-increasing urbanization process, the traffic jam has become a common problem in the metropolises around the world, making the traffic speed prediction a crucial and fundamental task. This task is difficult due to the dynamic and intrinsic complexity of the traffic environment in urban cities, yet the emergence of crowd map query data sheds new light on it. In general, a burst of crowd map queries for the same destination in a short duration (called ``hotspot'') could lead to traffic congestion. For example, queries of the Capital Gym burst on weekend evenings lead to traffic jams around the gym. However, unleashing the power of crowd map queries is challenging due to the innate spatiotemporal characteristics of the crowd queries.
