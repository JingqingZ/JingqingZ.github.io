## Activities
* \[12/2019\] [PEGASUS](/publication/2019-PEGASUS), a pre-training model tailored for abstractive text summarization, is now public. This work is completed together with my excellent colleagues during my internship at Google Research, Brain Team. 
* \[10/2019\] Two papers accepted by [BIBM 2019](https://ieeebibm.org/BIBM2019/). One about unsupervised phenotype annotation on medical notes [\[more\]](/publication/2019-BIBM-HPO) and the other using VAE to extract low dimentional features from multi-omics data [\[more\]](/publication/2019-BIBM-VAE).
* \[04/2019\] TensorLayer 2.0 has been released! [\[Github\]](https://github.com/tensorlayer/tensorlayer) [\[Doc\]](https://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io)
* \[03/2019\] Our paper about zero-shot text classification was presented as a talk in NAACL-HLT'19 [\[more\]](/publication/2019-KG4TextClass).
* \[12/2018\] Together with [Dr. Luo Mai](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~lm111/), we gave a talk at [GDG DevFest London 2018](https://devfest.gdg.london/) about [TensorLayer](https://github.com/tensorlayer): [video](https://youtu.be/064_cf5JlbM?t=16282)
