## Abstract
This paper introduces the TensorDB system, a framework that fuses database infrastructure and application software to streamline the development, training, evaluation and analysing machine learning models. The design principle is to track the whole model building process with database and connected different components by database query mechanism. This design produces a highly flexible framework enable each component to be updated independently. The theoretical value is that it enables continuous machine learning. TensorDB is motivated by production application of machine learning model as consolidation of many engineering practice, and is could be served as the foundation for high level tools for machine learning application.
